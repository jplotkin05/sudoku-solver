## üîç Overview

This repository provides a command-line Sudoku solver algorithm written in Rust.  
It takes a partially filled Sudoku board and attempts to solve it, yielding a completed board if the puzzle is valid and solvable.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Pure Rust implementation  
- Efficient backtracking / search-based solver  
- Clean and minimal dependencies  
- Unit-tested logic  
- Simple CLI for running puzzles  

---

## üéØ Motivation

The project was built to:

- Explore algorithmic problem solving in Rust  
- Practice ownership, borrowing, and efficient data structures  
- Provide a simple tool for solving Sudoku puzzles  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jplotkin05/sudoku-solver.git
cd sudoku-solver
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Building

Build the project in release mode for best performance:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running

Run the solver with a Sudoku input file:

```bash
cargo run -- puzzles/example.txt
```

- Input must be a text file with the Sudoku grid written row by row.  
- Use `.` or `0` to represent blank cells.  
- The solver will print the solved board (or report if unsolvable).

## üñº Examples

### Example Input (`puzzles/example.txt`):

```
5 3 . . 7 . . . .
6 . . 1 9 5 . . .
. 9 8 . . . . 6 .
8 . . . 6 . . . 3
4 . . 8 . 3 . . 1
7 . . . 2 . . . 6
. 6 . . . . 2 8 .
. . . 4 1 9 . . 5
. . . . 8 . . 7 9
```

### Example Run:

```bash
cargo run -- puzzles/example.txt
```

### Example Output:

```
5 3 4 6 7 8 9 1 2
6 7 2 1 9 5 3 4 8
1 9 8 3 4 2 5 6 7
8 5 9 7 6 1 4 2 3
4 2 6 8 5 3 7 9 1
7 1 3 9 2 4 8 5 6
9 6 1 5 3 7 2 8 4
2 8 7 4 1 9 6 3 5
3 4 5 2 8 6 1 7 9
```
